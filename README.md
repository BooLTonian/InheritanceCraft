# InheritanceCraft
All rights to Minecraft are reserved by Mojang, and all rights to the Inheritance Cycle are reserved by Christopher Paolini, and/or his publishing company, and/or something else. I don't know. I'll figure that out when I have to.
InheritanceCraft is a Minecraft mod that will add the magic system from the Inheritance cycle to the game, potentially alongside other features of the books.
If I get something wrong in the mod, feel free to inform me, unless it is one of the following:
  1. Something that happens past like page 270 of Brisingr.

The above list contains what it does because the mod does not exist yet, and I technically have yet to finish the series, and it may change to include things that are wrong within the mod due to my lack of ability, lack of knowledge, an opinion of mine, or that I've yet to get around to whatever the issue is.

Plans for the future:

  I would like to create a system that takes away the need for you to have prepared spells, and lets you arrange the words as you please, but this will likely be next to impossible.
  
  As an alternative to the above, if that proves necessary, words of power from the ancient language could be used in gramarye which would be a similar spellcrafting sytem to TC6, Ars Magica, PSI, etcetera.
  
  A unique mana system based off the soul energy from the books.
  You should be able to draw mana from other living beings, and commune it in crystals. (Diamond, Quartz, Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, Amethyst, Topaz, Create a dictionary of recognized crystal names, and allotted power capacitance)
  
  Color based intention detection system where there are seperate colors for a mob who is player(flow through rainbow), hostile, hostile and aggroed elsewhere, capable of being provoked,not hostile to you but hostile to something else, not hostile to you but aggroed to something else, and entirely passive. Distance of detectability based on maxMana•currentMana?
  
  HP and hunger(only saturation) should be tapped into when mana is depleted, and you die if you run out of HP.
  
  The default max mana for a creature should be based on it's max health. This could increase via a leveling system.
  
  Dragons (Lacking much more sentience than a vanilla horse, but with lore-accurate abilities otherwise.)
  
  Dwarfs, Elves, and Urgals. (All not likely to occur, as making them equivalent to reskinned villagers, with some additions would strip them of everything that made them interesting. Urgals may make it in for hostile purposes, but would strip them of many important facets.)
