# InheritanceCraft
All rights to Minecraft are reserved by Mojang, and all rights to the Inheritance Cycle are reserved by Christopher Paolini, and/or his publishing company, and/or something else. I don't know. I'll figure that out when I have to.

-------------------------------------------------------

InheritanceCraft is a Minecraft mod that will add a variety of elements from the Inheritance Cycle to Minecraft. The end goal of this mod is to add a magic system as similar as possible to the books, but as it is being developed by a highly inexperienced programmer, that will be the last feature, and may end up never happening.

-------------------------------------------------------

Current plan of action:

Develop a more complete list of things from the book, then add them to the game. (Dwarfs, Elves, Urgals, and Werecats, due to their civilized nature are likely not to be added.)

-------------------------------------------------------

-Current list-

Entities:

Dragons

Lethrblaka/Ra'zac

Fanghur

Feldûnost

Shrrg

Urzhad

Nagra

Nïdhwal

Snalglí

Sundavrblaka

-------------------------------------------------------

Items:

Seithr Oil

Skilna Bragh

Tunivor's Nectar

Fairth

Brightsteel (oreDict to mithril?)

Brightsteel tools and weapons

Hûthvír

Faelnirv

Dragon saddles

Gem carrying amenities(belt, staff, etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------

Tile entities:

Eldunarí

Lethrblaka Egg

Dragon egg

Delois

Fricai Andlát

Loivissa

Talos

Vaer Ethilnadras

-------------------------------------------------------

Blocks:

Brightsteel block

Brightsteel Meteor Fragment

-------------------------------------------------------

Although it is not uploaded there is in fact some work done on this mod. I just have no idea how to use git, and make it show up here.

-------------------------------------------------------

What's currently implemented:

Find someone to make models for me.

Brightsteel tools (they don't work lol)

Seithr Oil (doesn't work yet lol)

A class-object that can manage "mana"(originally, magic was the only major goal, not all the other stuff)
