# InheritanceCraft
All rights to Minecraft are reserved by Mojang, and all rights to the Inheritance Cycle are reserved by Christopher Paolini, and/or his publishing company, and/or something else. I don't know. I'll figure that out when I have to.

InheritanceCraft is a Minecraft mod that will add a variety of elements from the Inheritance Cycle to Minecraft. The end goal of this mod is to add a magic system as similar as possible to the books, but as it is being developed by a highly inexperienced programmer, that will be the last feature, and may end up never happening.

Current plan of action:
Develop a more complete list of things from the book, then add them to the game. (Dwarfs, Elves, Urgals, and Werecats, due to their civilized nature are likely not to be added.)
